After returning to Iran, he created his first work at the age of 23, a memorial monument on the grave of Abu-Ali Sina. Seyhun is noted specially for his innovative and creative architectural design. Seyhoon became famous for his design work in the 1950s in Iran, including: Tehran’s Central Railway Station and tombs of scientific/literary figures.

In his will he asked that all his paintings and drawings be given to a museum in Iran.
